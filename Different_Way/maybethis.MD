# Location and Era-Based Fashion and Festival Recommendations

## 1. Data Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure all entries are consistent and usable.
- Convert the dataset into a format suitable for analysis (e.g., CSV to DataFrame).

## 2. Feature Engineering
- Extract relevant features from the data, such as year, season, and categories.
- Add location-based data, if available, to tie fashion trends to specific regions.

## 3. Trend Analysis
- Analyze the dataset to identify fashion trends over time and across different regions.
- Use clustering algorithms to group similar items based on their attributes (e.g., colour, type, season).

## 4. Recommendation System
- Develop a recommendation engine that suggests fashion items based on the user's location, the current season, and upcoming festivals.
- Implement collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to enhance recommendations.

## 5. Integration with External Data
- Integrate with external APIs to get current festival information and location-based weather data to tailor recommendations.

## 6. User Interface
- Develop a user-friendly interface to display the recommendations, allowing users to input their location and preferences.

## Sample Python Code

### Basic Recommendation Based on Year and Season

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('/home/codemaster29/Documents/Coding_Stuff/Operations_on_Python/weforshe/styles.csv')

# Preprocess data
data.dropna(inplace=True)  # Remove missing values
data['year'] = data['year'].astype(int)

# Sample function to recommend fashion based on year and season
def recommend_fashion(year, season):
    recommendations = data[(data['year'] == year) & (data['season'] == season)]
    return recommendations[['articleType', 'baseColour', 'productDisplayName']]

# Example usage
year = 2016
season = 'Winter'
recommendations = recommend_fashion(year, season)
print(recommendations)

# Further steps would involve location-based data integration and a more advanced recommendation algorithm.
# Example function to recommend fashion based on location, year, and season
def recommend_fashion_location_based(location, year, season):
    # This is a placeholder for actual location-based filtering
    location_filtered_data = data[data['location'] == location]
    recommendations = location_filtered_data[(location_filtered_data['year'] == year) & (location_filtered_data['season'] == season)]
    return recommendations[['articleType', 'baseColour', 'productDisplayName']]

# Example usage
location = 'New York'
year = 2016
season = 'Winter'
recommendations = recommend_fashion_location_based(location, year, season)
print(recommendations)

## For Festival.....
import requests

# Function to get festivals for a given location and month
def get_festivals(location, month):
    # Placeholder URL, replace with actual API endpoint
    url = f'https://api.festivals.com/{location}/{month}'
    response = requests.get(url)
    festivals = response.json()
    return festivals

# Example usage
location = 'New York'
month = 'December'
festivals = get_festivals(location, month)
print(festivals)
